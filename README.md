# bybook
My personal website.  
As the website failed to be deployed, try either   
watch **video demo** on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16hcTzuEaZ/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=6577cb199105b49e25127c31f0261c8d)  
or **run locally**: create an empty directory called bybook then run the following code in terminal:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/by0616/bybook.git
npm install
npm run dev
</pre>  
and command click the link given in the terminal!
